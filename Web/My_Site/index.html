            <p>I like to develop apps that are fun and practical (though not necessarily in that order). 
                C# and Java are my go-to languages, and I've published an app on the Google Play store.
            </p>

                <td style="width: 600px;height:200px;"><p>My strengths lie in developing robust, well-documented code on the backend of applications. My languages of choice are C#, Java and Python.
                       I'm proficient in developing console, WPF, and MVC applications as well as creating and maintaing REST APIs at an enterprise level. In addition to backend development,
                       I also have Android application development experience, from prototyping all the way to publishing and monitoring analytics.

                <td style="width: 600px;height:200px;">Beyond application development, I also have a deep understanding of SQL databases and their cloud counterparts. I have years of industry experience
                    using TSQL and Microsoft SQL Server, with MySQL sprinkled in. I've worked primarily in an Azure cloud environment in my most recent position, and an
                    Amazon EC2/AWS environment prior.

                    <p>Beyond career development work, I like to keep my skills sharp and learn about new technologies and tools at home. I've developed a board game
                       and an RPG style game using C# and Ruby, respectively. I'm frequently retooling my Raspberry Pi to be a part of some new project that I've found.
                       When I'm not programming, I enjoy playing my drums and bass guitar as well as gaming, model-building, puzzle-solving, and cooking.
